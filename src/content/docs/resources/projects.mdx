Each of the projects below leverage Hyperlight for isolation and provide support for language runtimes, POSIX 
microkernels, and much more. 

## Hyperlight Wasm

Hyperlight Wasm is a project that enables Wasm modules to be run within the Hyperlight secure boundary using 
Wasmtime. Its purpose is to enable applications to run untrusted or third party Wasm code within the VM 
isolation boundary with very low latency and resource utilization. 

<Aside> Hyperlight Wasm is in early stages. It is functional, but is still very much a work in progress.</Aside>

## Hyperlight Nanvix

Hyperlight Nanvix is a project that runs the [Nanvix][nanvix] microkernel inside the Hyperlight secure boundary. The Nanvix
microkernel provides support for a broad set of POSIX APIs and support delegation of syscalls between the host and
guest as well as syscall interposition (interception).

The broad POSIX compatability of Nanvix provides the ability to run JavaScript, Python, C, C++, and Rust programs.
Similar to Hyperlight runtimes, Hyperlight Nanvix offers low latency cold starts in the 10 - 20 millisecond range for
optimized workloads.

## Cargo Hyperlight

Cargo Hyperlight is a `cargo` subcommand to help with building Hyperlight guest binaries. 

Hyperlight's extremely limited guest API can make it challenging to build guests targeting the environment. `cargo-hyperlight`
was created to make it easier to build guest binaries. In fact, if your bin or any of its dependencies have a `build.rs`
script using `cc` and `bindgen` to compile C code and generate bindings, they will often work without change!

## Hyperlight JavaScript

Hyperlight runtime for executing JavaScript within the Hyperlight secure boundary. It provides the ability to cold
start JS applications in single digit milliseconds, perfect for the basis of a functions runtime. The runtime also 
provides the ability to register host functions which allow for extending functionality of the guest JavaScript
code executing within the Hypervisor protected boundary. 

<Aside> Hyperlight JS is coming soon... Stay tuned.</Aside>
