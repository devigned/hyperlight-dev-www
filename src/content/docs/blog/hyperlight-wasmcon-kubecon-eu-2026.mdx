At WasmCon, co-located with KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2026 in Amsterdam on March 23, [Danilo (Dan) Chiarlone](https://github.com/danbugs) from Microsoft will present on running the Wasmtime WebAssembly runtime inside Hyperlight's hardware-isolated micro-VMs. This talk will explore how combining Wasmtime with Hyperlight provides dual-layer security — a WebAssembly software sandbox inside a hypervisor-enforced VM boundary — while maintaining fast cold starts.
