At Wasm I/O 2026 in Barcelona on March 19, [Lucy Menon](https://github.com/syntactically), [Ralph Squillace](https://github.com/squillace), and [Tomasz Andrzejak](https://github.com/andreiltd) will lead a hands-on workshop on building and running WebAssembly workloads inside Hyperlight's hardware-isolated micro-VMs. This workshop will cover the practical steps of using Hyperlight Wasm — from compiling Wasm components to running them in sub-millisecond VMs with dual-layer security.
