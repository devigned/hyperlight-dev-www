The Microsoft Azure Core Upstream team announced Hyperlight, an open-source Rust library for executing small, embedded functions using hypervisor-based protection at scale. Hyperlight creates micro-VMs in 1–2 milliseconds — about two orders of magnitude faster than traditional VMs — by eliminating the guest OS, virtual devices, and kernel boot entirely. The post covers the motivation behind Hyperlight, its architecture, and includes a Rust code walkthrough. Written by [Yosh Wuyts](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts).
