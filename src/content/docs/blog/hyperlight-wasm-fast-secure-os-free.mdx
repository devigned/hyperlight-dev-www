This post announces Hyperlight Wasm, a Hyperlight VM micro-guest that runs WebAssembly component workloads written in many programming languages via the Wasmtime runtime. By combining Hyperlight's hardware VM isolation with Wasm's software sandbox, it delivers dual-layer security with 1–2 ms cold starts and broad language compatibility through WASI and the Component Model. The post also covers Azure Front Door Edge Actions, powered by Hyperlight. Written by [Yosh Wuyts](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts).
