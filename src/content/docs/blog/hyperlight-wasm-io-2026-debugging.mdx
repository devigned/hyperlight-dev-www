At Wasm I/O 2026 in Barcelona on March 19, [Doru Blânzeanu](https://github.com/dblnz) will present on the challenges and solutions for debugging WebAssembly code running inside Hyperlight's hardware-isolated micro-VMs. Building on Hyperlight's GDB/LLDB debugging support, this talk will explore how to step through Wasm execution across the hardware memory partition boundary that separates the guest VM from the host.
