This post introduces GDB and LLDB debugging support for Hyperlight micro-VM guests, enabling developers to attach a debugger at runtime and step through code executing inside a hardware-protected VM. It walks through a hands-on example using the KubeCon NA 2024 demo application, explains the technical architecture of how the GDB protocol communicates across the VM boundary, and covers supported features including breakpoints, memory/register inspection, and instruction stepping.
