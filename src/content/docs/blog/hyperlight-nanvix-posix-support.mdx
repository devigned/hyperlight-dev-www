title: "Hyperlight Nanvix: POSIX support for Hyperlight Micro-VMs"

This post announces the integration of the Nanvix microkernel with Hyperlight, providing over 150 POSIX system calls inside hardware-isolated micro-VMs. By combining Hyperlight's VM isolation with Nanvix's minimal Rust-based microkernel, applications written in Python, JavaScript, C, C++, and Rust can now run with full hardware isolation and double-digit-millisecond cold starts — addressing the "serverless trilemma" of fast cold starts, secure isolation, and runtime compatibility. Written by [Danilo Chiarlone](https://github.com/danbugs) and [Pedro Henrique Penna](https://github.com/ppenna).
