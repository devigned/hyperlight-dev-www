This tutorial demonstrates how to create a Hyperlight guest application in C that uses the QuickJS JavaScript engine to securely execute arbitrary JavaScript inside a hardware-protected micro-VM. It walks through building the guest using the Hyperlight C API, compiling with clang against Hyperlight's custom libc, and creating a Rust host application that loads and calls the guest.
